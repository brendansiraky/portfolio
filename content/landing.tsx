				<p>
					Hi, I'm Brendan, and I've been in the software development
					game for over 8 years now. My focus is on full-stack
					development, which means I handle everything from the
					frontend (like Mobile and Web applications) to the backend,
					including Blockchain Applications, often referred to as
					dApps.
				</p>

				<p>
					My journey began in 2014 when I started tinkering with HTML
					and CSS to create static webpages. This led me to dive into
					JavaScript, exploring frameworks like React and React
					Native. Backend-wise, I've focused on Node.js, building
					robust applications.
				</p>

				<p>
					More recently, I've been fascinated by blockchain
					technology. I've been exploring the world of Ethereum and
					learning how to write Solidity contracts, which are the
					backbone of smart contracts that run on the Ethereum
					network.
				</p>

				<p>
					Over the years I have had the pleasure of being involved in
					quite a number of large and small scale projects. Iâ€™ve
					worked as a freelancer, a full-stack developer at{' '}
					<ExternalLink href="https://jadendigital.com.au/">
						<>Jaden Digital</>
					</ExternalLink>
					, a couple of different start-ups in the cryptocurrency
					world where I was the lead developer, and now currently as
					an engineer at{' '}
